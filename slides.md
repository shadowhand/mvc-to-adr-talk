Note: Who has used MVC?
  Heard of ADR? 
  Used ADR?

----

## Model
## View
## Controller

Note: possibly most widely used design pattern in web

----

It is a software *design pattern*.

----

It separates the *mental mode*  
from the *computer model*.

Note: user ui != computer ui //
  ux = how elegant the transformation is

----

[![MVC by Trygver](img/mvc-2006.gif)](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html)

Note: <3

----

It was made for GUI applications.

Note: history in a minute //
  predates the web

----

Later adopted for web applications.

Note: desktop is different than the web //
  on to history

---

# MVC in PHP

Note: history over

----

**Really** popular.

Note: majority of frameworks use it //
  excluding CMS space //
  popularity is familiarity

----

**Good** starting point.

Note: organizing code = win //
  any structure is better than none //
  separates mental/computer model

----

It **works**.

*Mostly.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: only one design pattern //
  is pretty high level //
  remember the gui?

----

> MVC, as originally envisaged, is not an end-to-end monolithic application pattern, it's a UI pattern.

[*Nate Abele* - 2014](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/5993#comment-2597)

----

Web applications are fundamentally  
different than desktop applications.

Note: talk about server side apps for a minute //
  the great mismatch

---

# GUI vs Web

Note: life cycle fundamental difference //
  request, response

----

Request ‚Üù Response

Note: app flow is constant //
  state is maintained all the time //
  http is stateless

----

HTTP is stateless.

Note: if something is nowhere, it can be anywhere

----

How can a desktop pattern work for the web?

----

By meddling with the pattern.

üò± <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Model was meant to be a domain *gateway*.

Note: gateway/coordinator //
  problem domain //
  application model (mvp reference)

----

View was meant to contain some *logic*.

Note: more purpose than just a template //
  aware of the model data (read only)

----

Controller was meant to handle *input* and *state*.

Note: domain logic does not go here //
  coordinates model output and view input //
  commands

----

Every screen was a *multitude* of MVC triads.

Note: HMVC // widgets //
  dissonance with original intent

---

## #controllerproblems

Note: not universal problems

----

Controller has become synonymous with *resource*.

Note: multiple routes go to the same place //
  users controller //
  products controller //
  blog controller

----

```php
'GET /users' => 'UsersController::all',
'GET /users/{id}' => 'UsersController::one',
'POST /users/{id}' => 'UsersController::update',
'POST /users/{id}/follow' => 'UsersController::follow',
```

Note: how many have seen this? //
  maybe even less routes? //
  one route per controller!

----

Controller has become a *"God Object"*.

Note: anti-pattern //
  separation of concerns //
  multiple HTTP methods = code smell

----

Controllers were meant to be *thin*.

Few dependencies, not much logic. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: put domain where it belongs //
  ease of refactoring //
  testability

----

Original purpose of controllers...

![Controller Responsibility](img/controller-responsibility.png)

Note: state is user state, not application state //
  input and state come from? //
  commands for model and view //
  keep thinking about this

---

## #modelproblems

----

Model has become *storage*.

Note: applications are more than storage //
  where are application rules? //
  where is domain code? //

----

Models were meant to be *thick*.

Many dependencies, not big classes. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: gateway for domain //
  lots of coordination //
  authorization //
  application rules //
  storage separate

----

Original purpose of models ...

![Model Responsibility](img/model-responsibility.png)

Note: receives commands //
  produces output //
  coordinates domain, does not replace it

---

## #viewproblems

----

View has become a *template*.

Note: where do headers go? //
  where is content type? //
  API vs HTML formatting //
  multi format of web

----

Views were meant to be *dumb*.

Very little context, not free of logic. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Note: formatting of data //
  specific to type of output //
  pacman chomp chomp

----

Original purpose of views ...

![Model Responsibility](img/view-responsibility.png)

Note: receives data //
  prepares for display

---

# Despair

> ... the more I learn about MVC, the more I think it has little to nothing to do with server-side web applications.

[*Nate Abele* - 2014](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/5993#comment-2597)

Note: is all lost? //
  is there something better?

---

# Enter ADR

----

## Action
## Domain
## Responder

Note: created by Paul M Jones in 2014 //
  replacement for MVC on the web

----

## Similar to MVC

Action ‚Üî Controller

Domain ‚Üî Model

Responder ‚Üî View

Note: web specific //
  note order

----

## Different from MVC

----

### Action

- does not manipulate Responder
- is always singular <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Domain

- does not interact with Responder
- might not be a concrete component <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Responder

- does not interact with Domain
- corresponds with Action <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- generates a complete response <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

![ADR Flow](img/adr-flow.png) <!-- .element style="max-height:600px" -->

----

![MVC Flow](img/mvc-flow.png) <!-- .element style="max-height:600px" -->

----

## Benefits?

- clean break from existing terms
- (possibly) better separation of concerns <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- domain is a first class citizen <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: possibly easier to reason about //
  web specific, easier to adapt //
  simplified data flow

---

# Hope

----

Is ADR here to save us all?

Note: my thinking has evolved

----

Time to explore code.

---

# ADR Example

Basic user login.

Note: PSR-7 interfaces

----

```php
public function __invoke(Request $request): Response
{
    // No domain interaction required.
    return $this->responder->response();
}
```

Note: action for showing login

----

```php
public function response(): Response
{
    $content = $this->templates->render('login');
    return $this->htmlResponse($content);
}

private function htmlResponse(string $content): Response
{
    // ...
}
```

Note: responder for showing login

----

```php
public function response(): Response
{
    // ...
}

private function htmlResponse(string $content): Response
{
    $body = $this->streamFactory->createStream($content);
    return $this->responseFactory->createResponse()
        ->withHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
        ->withBody($body);
}
```

Note: responder for showing login

----

And now with more **input**.

Note: command bus usage

----

```php
public function __invoke(Request $request): Response
{
    $post = $request->getParsedBody();
    $command = LoginCommand::byUsername(
        $post['username'],
        $post['password']
    );
    return $this->attempt($command);
}

private function attempt(LoginCommand $command): Response
{
    // ...
}
```

Note: post login action

----

```php
private function attempt(LoginCommand $command): Response
{
    try {
        $user = $this->bus->handle($command);
    } catch (LoginFailedException $e) {
        return $this->responder->failed($command, $e);
    }

    return $this->success($user);
}

private function success(User $user): Response
{
    // ...
}
```

Note: post login action //
  domain exception

----

```php
private function attempt(LoginCommand $command): Response
{
    // ...
}

private function success(User $user): Response
{
    $this->session->set('userid', $user->id);
    $this->session->set('username', $user->username);
    return $this->responder->redirect('/user/profile');
}
```

Note: post login action

----

```php
public function failed(
    LoginCommand $command,
    LoginFailedException $e
): Response
{
    $data = [
        'input' => $command->toArray(),
        'errors' => $e->getErrors(),
    ]
    $content = $this->templates->render('login_failed', $data);
    return $this->htmlResponse($content);
}
```

Note: post login responder //
  html response is reused

----

```php
public function failed(/* ... */): Response
{
    // ...
}

public function redirect(string $target): Response
{
    return $this->responseFactory->createResponse(302)
        ->>withHeader('Location', $target);
}
```

Note: post login responder

---

# Do we need ADR?

Note: or "Does this work with MVC?" //
  my thinking has changed

----

What about all that life cycle stuff?

MVC is a design pattern. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: not an architecture pattern

----

![MVC by Trygver](img/mvc-2006.gif)

----

![ADR by Woody](img/adr-2017.gif)

----

> The point here is that the domain should be utterly unaware of what presentations may be used with it.

[*Martin Fowler* - 2006](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SeparatedPresentation.html)

----

Don't let MVC dictate your domain architecture.

Keep domain code out of presentation code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Use what works for you.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: remember what mvc is and isn't //
  adr isn't actually radical

---

Everything will be okay.
