# PHP MVC

- hugely popular
- helps organize code
- has changed meaning

# Evolution

- request/response life cycle
- stateless http vs gui
- multiple actions per controller
- model vs domain
- model vs application model
- active vs passive view

# Problems

- "god" controllers
- model replaces domain
- template is not a view
- discourages DDD

# ADR

- what it is
- why it came about
- how it helps

# ADR vs MVC

- similar but different
- action is singular
- domain is a gateway
- responder is agnostic

# Benefits

- clean break from existing terms
- separation of concerns
- domain is a first class citizen
- easier to reason about
- responder handles output

# Exploration

- what an action does
- how it talks to the domain
- output conversion to response

# Examples

- oauth2-demos application
